This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python-based MIDI note recorder project designed to receive MIDI input and temporarily record musical notes. The project is currently in its initial setup phase.

## Project Structure

- `README.md` - Project description in Japanese
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Claude Code permissions configuration

## Development Environment

This project is intended to be developed in Python. No specific Python environment or dependency management files are currently present.

## Current State

The repository contains only documentation and configuration files. The main Python implementation for MIDI note recording has not yet been created.

## Notes

- The project title and README are in Japanese, indicating this is likely a Japanese-language project
- The project appears to be part of a larger "AI自動演奏ねこびっとくん" (AI Automatic Performance Neko-bit) system
- No specific build, test, or development commands are available as the codebase is not yet implemented
